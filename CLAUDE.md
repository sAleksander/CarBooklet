# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Commands

For commands look up @README.md

Pre-commit hooks: husky + lint-staged runs `eslint --fix` on `*.{ts,tsx,astro}` and
`prettier --write` on `*.{json,css,md}`.

## Architecture

### Rendering mode

Full server-side rendering (`output: "server"` in astro.config.mjs). All pages and API routes are
server-rendered by default.

### Auth flow

- `src/lib/supabase.ts` — Supabase SSR client via `@supabase/ssr`, cookie-based sessions.
  Uses `astro:env/server` for secrets — SUPABASE_URL/SUPABASE_KEY are never exposed to client code.
- `src/middleware.ts` — resolves current user on every request, attaches to `context.locals.user`.
  Redirects unauthenticated users away from routes in `PROTECTED_ROUTES`.
- API endpoints: `src/pages/api/auth/{signin,signup,signout}.ts`
- Protected page example: `src/pages/dashboard.astro`

### Key conventions

- **Path alias**: `@/*` → `./src/*` (tsconfig paths).
- Never use React for non-interactive sections — .astro components only for layout and static content
- **Tailwind class merging**: use `cn()` from `@/lib/utils` (clsx + tailwind-merge). No manual class string concatenation.
- **shadcn/ui**: components in `src/components/ui/`, "new-york" style. Add with `npx shadcn@latest add [name]`.
- **API routes**: uppercase `GET`, `POST` exports; validate input with zod.
- **Supabase migrations**: `supabase/migrations/` with `YYYYMMDDHHmmss_short_description.sql`. Enable RLS on every new table with per-operation, per-role policies.
- **React**: no Next.js directives ("use client"). Extract hooks to `src/components/hooks/`.
- **Services/helpers**: `src/lib/` (or `src/lib/services/` for extracted business logic).
- **Shared types** (entities, DTOs): `src/types.ts`.

## Environment

- Node.js v22.14.0 (see `.nvmrc`)
- Env vars: `SUPABASE_URL`, `SUPABASE_KEY` — copy `.env.example` to `.env` for Node, or `.dev.vars` for Cloudflare local dev
- Local Supabase: `npx supabase start` (requires Docker, ~7 GB RAM)
- Deploy: `npx wrangler deploy` (requires Cloudflare account + `wrangler login`)

## CI

GitHub Actions (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`) runs lint + build on push/PR to master.
Requires `SUPABASE_URL` and `SUPABASE_KEY` as repository secrets.

## 10xDevs AI Toolkit - Module 2, Lesson 3

Review AI-generated code before merge with the **implementation review chain**:

```
/10x-implement -> /10x-impl-review -> triage -> (/10x-lesson | fix | skip | disagree)
```

`/10x-impl-review` is the lesson focus. Review is a quality gate, not an instruction to fix every finding.

### Task Router - Where to start

| Skill | Use it when |
| --- | --- |
| **Code review (lesson focus)** | |
| `/10x-impl-review <change-id>` | You have implemented code and want a structured review before merge. The skill checks plan adherence, scope discipline, safety and quality, architecture, pattern consistency, and success criteria, then presents findings for triage. |
| **Recurring lesson outcome** | |
| `/10x-lesson` | A finding reveals a recurring project rule or agent failure pattern. Record it in `context/foundation/lessons.md` instead of treating it as a one-off note. |

### Triage discipline

- Severity says how bad the finding is. Impact says how much the decision matters now.
- Valid outcomes: fix now, fix differently, skip, accept as risk, record as recurring rule (`/10x-lesson`), disagree.
- Fix critical findings. Do not burn hours on low-impact observations just because the agent found them.
- Conscious skipping of low-impact findings is a valid review outcome, not negligence.
- If you disagree with a finding, record why. Wrong agent reasoning is also signal.

### Review boundaries

- This lesson reviews implemented code. It does not create the plan, execute new phases, or teach CI review.
- Testing strategy and quality gates are introduced in Module 3.
- Do not use `/10x-contract` as a triage outcome in this lesson.

### Paths used by this lesson

- `context/changes/<change-id>/plan.md` - expected implementation contract
- `context/changes/<change-id>/reviews/` - review output
- `context/foundation/lessons.md` - recurring lessons

Skills must not write to `context/archive/`. Archived changes are immutable; if a resolved target path starts with `context/archive/`, abort with: "This change is archived. Open a new change with `/10x-new` instead."
